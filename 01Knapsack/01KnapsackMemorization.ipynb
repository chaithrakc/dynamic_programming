If we get it the first time, we can solve this problem by creating a 2-D array that can store a particular state (n, w). Now if we come across the same state (n, w) again instead of calculating it in exponential complexity we can directly return its result stored in the table in constant time. This method gives an edge over the recursive approach in this aspect.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RwyZx3mVOEH3"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"1zUFb8KnI-eQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1676065015603,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Chaithra K.C","userId":"06590399226295405413"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Driver code\n","val = [60, 100, 120]\n","wt = [10, 20, 30]\n","W = 50\n","n = len(val)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from typing import List\n","\n","# We initialize the matrix with -1 at first.\n","t = [[-1 for j in range(W+1)] for i in range(n+1)]\n","\n","def knapsack(weight:List[int], values:List[int], W:int, n:int) -> int:\n","  if W==0 or n==0:\n","    return 0\n","  if t[n][W] != -1:\n","    return t[n][W]\n","\n","  if weight[n-1] <= W:\n","    t[n][W] = max(values[n-1]+knapsack(weight, values, W-weight[n-1], n-1), knapsack(weight, values, W, n-1)) # choose between not including and including\n","    return t[n][W]\n","  elif weight[n-1] > W:\n","    t[n][W] = knapsack(weight, values, W, n-1) # no including\n","    return t[n][W]\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ipbdyxWfOjmI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1676065015605,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Chaithra K.C","userId":"06590399226295405413"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["max_total_val_knapsack = knapsack(wt, val, W, n)\n","print(max_total_val_knapsack)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FbfeKSa7QgNz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1676065285084,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":132,"user":{"displayName":"Chaithra K.C","userId":"06590399226295405413"}},"outputId":"04b6074e-aa2c-4b5d-a166-ac6c39f7a117"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["220\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Time Complexity: O(N * W).
